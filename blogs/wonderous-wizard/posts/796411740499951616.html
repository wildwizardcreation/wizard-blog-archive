<p>i saw the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/insertsuggestedname/767878463359238144/kills-scar-with-my-bare-hands?source=share">"slay daddy" clip from jimmys pov that u posted</a> and FLIPPED because I WAS THERE for that stream so i *assumed* i had a clip of it from scars pov laying around somewhere BUT I DIDNT so i had to go on an insane quest to find a couple clips to stitch together BECAUSE THE HD VOD IS MISSING ????? UGH. </p>
<p>either way :3 yes scar is an insane bimbo slut whore who gets embarrassed at being compared to a teenage girl before immediately following it up with calling the older male peer who's scolding him daddy (and subsequently getting 10x more embarrassed after realizing that he just said that out loud). literally what is wrong with him.</p></div>
