<p>hey gang! terrible news!</p>
<p>i am officially out of a working tablet AND a working computer!</p>
<p>while my tablet's issue is simply the screen not turning on, my pc is officially cooked after almost 8 years of long and hard service. i knew it was dying fast but was really hoping for it to at least make it until the holidays when i'd get some extra cash. unfortunately after daily blue-screens since feburary it officially refuses to stay on for more than 10 minutes at a time, which makes me fresh out of a fully functioning machine.</p>
<h2>if you've ever gotten a kick out of my work in any capacity and want to toss a dollar or two my way: <a href="https://ko-fi.com/wildwizardcreation">i've set up a ko-fi to try and help with some of the costs</a></h2>
<p>no guilt tripping or shaming if you can't donate! i absolutely get it! i appreciate y'all so much and i'm sorry i can't offer anything in return right now.</p>
<p>i've been considering a lot of different ways to try and monetize my work as of late, but the last thing i want to do is gatekeep or worse entirely exclude any amount of people from being able to see my stuff. and with the recent porn bans/general absurdity of my work it's not exactly like i can waltz into redbubble and offer stickers with scar's taint on them. if i manage to think of something: you all will be the first to know. ty again for being so patient with me through everything through this year. it means more than i can ever possibly describe. no matter what happens i'll be back on my feet soon :]</p>
