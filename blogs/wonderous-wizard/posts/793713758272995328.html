  <div class="question"><p>I was super excited to find out you made a gallery, but it just loads forever for me. I've even tried different browsers, disabling adblock, the works. Weird as it is to say, I hope it's a problem with the site and not my computer because between you and me you're the only one skilled enough to fix it and you definitely can't fix my computer.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I don't THINK you're that kind of wizard, at least</p>

  <div class="answer-content"><p>dw dw anon! fortunately it's (mostly likely) not ur computer! trying to get the gallery working across the board has been a tricky back and forth between me being a lazy dick (refusing to pay for a server + refusing to learn docker/react/vue) and balancing the amount of image files I'm trying to shove into the page (via cloudflare r2 objects (bruh)) ðŸ˜­ so it was bound to break at some point</p>
<p>i'll probably roll the method i'm using back to a slightly less performant but consistently working version until i can confirm it works 100% of the time :] ty for letting me know anon!!</p></div>
