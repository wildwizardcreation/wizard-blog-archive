  <div class="question"><p>â˜¢ Okay I'm actually really curious: why is the au's name Not The Real Thing? If it seems like I'm worried they're not blood related that's just. So ridiculous. Haha. </p>
<p>Anyways I also want to know LITERALLY EVERYTHING about it but the last thing I want to do is pressure you or come off as entitled. </p>
</div>
</div><div class="answer-block">
  <div class="answer-content"><p>HEHE dwdw anon it doesnt come off pressurey or entitled at all!! it makes me giddy knowing people are interested in the au :3 i've really been meaning to pick it back up but inspiration has been few and far between, yknow how it issss</p>
<p>HOWEVERRRR Not the Real Thing gets it's title from the song insomniac by jomm! explanation taken straight from a discord message abt this very thing:</p>
<blockquote>when i was trying to figure out a name i went over like 15 different things but i was on a hugeeee jomm kick at the time and like. augh. whether it ends good or bad they're still ending with these strange idealized versions of each other that Do Not exist. ryan will <em>always</em> see toby as this doughy faced scraped knees little kid while toby will <em>always</em> see his dad as this beacon of something <em>better</em>. they dont have flaws in their eyes and the both feel like theyre stealing something from the other by having these thoughts and feelings even when theyre being reciprocated. they are both perfect and terrible and theyre soooo #codependent its awesome</blockquote>

<p>toby is ryan's biological son who comes to live with him for a summer when he turns 17. it ends up spiraling out of control really fast when both of them have to catch up with feelings they've either been considering for too long (toby's hero worship of his dad) or hiding away for longer than they'd like to admit (ryan's memories of inappropriate feelings towards toby all through his Very young childhood and being cut off from him because of his divorce with no visitation rights) and toby ends up staying with him through the fall, winter, through his birthday, the holidays into the next year, etc</p>
<p>story wise i don't have a <em>ton</em> down right now but visually i have a pretty solid aesthetic! i've approached this project very vis-dev forward and it's definitely proven to be my favorite method of fleshing out wider world building. </p>

<p>^^^ i've been collecting a lot of inspiration from romantic dramadies, any films with HEAVY color grading, and anything where Daniel BrÃ¼hl looks extra dilfy sdkjhfks</p>

<p>^^^ i've ALSO been collecting a ton <small>(the pinterest board is bangin i just cant fit all of it into a pureref lmao)</small> of stuff to represent the very very unsubtle color symbolism i need surrounding toby and ryan at all times. (another explanation ripped straight from discord: )</p>
<blockquote>color language wise im a little insane about ryan being represented by golden hour and toby being represented by blue hour and/or more realistic and desaturated tones. ryan would have a sizeable house just because of what he does for a living, but it'd still be warm and fuzzy and comforting in every corner of his existence. its <em>his</em> space he's managed to curate after years and years of living alone. there's knick knacks and collectibles and drawings and cat toys and blankets everywhere you look and its infectiously homely. the idea of toby centric scenes (especially emotional ones) having this kinda jarring shift in atmosphere when he's still new to ryan's life and specifically when he's struggling with his thoughts and feelings about existing <em>intimately</em> in this space is SO good. to me </blockquote>
<p>genre/story beats wise the best way i can describe it is how my very good buddy @costello-xoxo put it: </p>
