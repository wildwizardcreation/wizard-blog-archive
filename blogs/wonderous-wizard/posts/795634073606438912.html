<p>while i do think primarily existing in nsfw and alt spaces instead of the mainstream is good and healthy, it always needs to be 100% of your own volition. i'm still struggling with the loneliness of being thrust into this space and sort of locked away here. while i think i would've slowly but surely migrated here on my own it's the fact that my skeletons were yanked from my closet and laid out for the world to see without any of my own input. it was enough to pretty definitively lock me out of all the relationships i formed on my sfw brand. it was enough to strip me of any reputation i had built and essentially blacklist me from working in any aspect of this fandom and fandoms akin to it. even if the people i was taken from aren't the best of friends i do still miss them. i miss a lot of aspects of catering to a larger audience and interacting with a larger community. and at the end of the day there is literally nothing i can do about it. nothing i can do without compromising my own beliefs, politics, and morals, which i refuse to do. especially right now. </p>
<p>idk. this is probably very dramatic and long winded for no reason but it's a strange grief that kind of hits me every now and then.</p>
