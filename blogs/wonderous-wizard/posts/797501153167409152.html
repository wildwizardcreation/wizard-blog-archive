  <div class="answer-content"><p>not just a phannie! (though they have an insanely important place in my heart and defined a huge chunk of my youth) I've been deep in the RPF grind for yeeeeears including but not limited to: Stampy/Squid, egobang, rubberbang, Matt/Ryan SuperMega, septiplier, Rhett/Link GMM, SkyLox, Matt/Ross skymediaoffices, jerma/ludwig, jerma/etalyx, James/Alekis cowchop, and a whole lot more I cannot remember. most of these are also ships I tinhat to varying degrees of genuine belief (arin hanson's habit of touching his employees, jack being bisexual and mark having internalised homophobia, whatever the fuck ludwig did to jerma, stampy and squid drunk flings until squaishy was a "serious thing", etc) </p>
<p>I love RPF forever and ever it is so good and normal and everyone should do it all the time ðŸ«¶ yayyyyy</p></div>
