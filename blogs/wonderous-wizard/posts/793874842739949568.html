  <div class="answer-content"><p>WEHEHEH yes indeed i do anon!! i'll be completely real i'm definitely a newgen fan cause of corenswet's superman but i've been dipping my toes into a lot more DC stuff and i've been enjoying it WAY more than i thought i would!! </p>
<p>i've always been a little comic-averse cause i always got overwhelmed with just how much shit would be going on in a page at any given time. but recently i went looking for a source for my friend to read absolute superman on, ended up indulging in some reading of my own, and got immediately hooked. i love supes as a character in almost every single variant i've seen (cause he's like,,,, the blueprint for my favorite Genre of Guy LMAO) but the absolute series has a special kick that i fucking adore. though i'm actually heading to a comic shop today to see if i can pick up a physical copy of all-star superman cause i've been itching to get my hands on what is, objectively, the best superman comic series to date &gt;:3</p></div>
